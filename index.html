       Since 1989, political activities in Kashmir have intensified dramatically due to a combination of internal and external factors. That year marked a turning point in the region’s history, as widespread dissatisfaction with political representation, governance, and perceived injustices led to the rise of militancy and mass protests. Local political parties, social organizations, and youth movements became increasingly active, voicing demands for autonomy, human rights, and the protection of Kashmiri identity.

               Warning Against Fake Fundraising in Janpur
            </h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
Authorities have issued a warning after reports surfaced that individuals posing as members of the Liberation Front have been collecting donations in Janpur. These fake militants are reportedly soliciting funds under the pretense of supporting the liberation struggle. Residents are urged to exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of any such fundraising activities before contributing. Genuine efforts by the Liberation Front follow official channels, and the public is advised not to fall prey to scams that exploit the name of the movement for personal gain.
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:10px; text-align:justify;">
            Experts say that such scams not only harm the credibility of legitimate organizations but also weaken public trust, making it more difficult for genuine movements to raise awareness and resources. Citizens are therefore urged to remain vigilant and support legitimate initiatives while rejecting any fraudulent solicitations.

The situation in Janpur serves as a reminder that while communities are eager to contribute to causes they believe in, careful verification and awareness are essential to prevent exploitation by fake operators. By staying informed and cautious, the public can continue to support the liberation struggle without falling victim to deception.

            Kashmir’s Struggle: Balancing Identity, Politics, and Peace

Since 1989, political activities in Kashmir have intensified dramatically due to a combination of internal and external factors. That year marked a turning point in the region’s history, as widespread dissatisfaction with political representation and governance led to the rise of protests and mobilizations. Local political parties, social organizations, and youth movements became increasingly active, voicing demands for autonomy, human rights, and the protection of Kashmiri identity. Simultaneously, militant groups emerged, challenging both state authorities and rival factions, further escalating tensions.The front of the liberation struggle is driven by dedicated and courageous individuals, yet some organizations have acted against their own people instead of focusing on external challenges. These internal divisions have complicated coordination, but the resolve of Kashmiris remains strong. In this environment, key leaders recently held important meetings to discuss future strategies, emphasizing unity, careful decision-making, and the protection of local interests. Discussions are ongoing at the international level as well, with diplomats and global organizations closely monitoring the situation, highlighting its significance beyond regional boundaries.

In response to broader unification efforts promoted by organizations advocating for a single Islamic identity across multiple countries, Kashmiris are preparing to officially declare loyalty to their own cultural and political identity. This move underscores the importance of preserving local heritage, language, and traditions while participating in a larger ideological framework. By asserting their Kashmiri identity, the community demonstrates that it is possible to support wider religious or political movements without compromising local autonomy or heritage.Peace remains a central goal in this complex scenario. Efforts such as Aman Etifaq, or formal peace agreements, aim to reduce hostilities, protect civilians, and create a framework for dialogue. Achieving peace requires justice, mutual understanding, and non-violent conflict resolution, both locally and internationally. </p>

                In response to the broader efforts aimed at uniting Muslim-majority regions under a single Islamic identity, Kashmiris are preparing to officially declare loyalty to their own cultural and political identity. This step is significant because it demonstrates the ability to maintain a distinct local heritage while participating in a wider ideological framework. Kashmir possesses a rich and unique cultural history, with its own language, traditions, and social norms, which the people are determined to preserve. By asserting their Kashmiri identity, they emphasize the importance of safeguarding their traditions, festivals, and community cohesion, even as they engage with broader Islamic solidarity. This approach reflects a careful balance between local autonomy and collective religious unity.

               Selfhood is more than just knowing your name or your personal details; it is the deeper awareness of your existence, thoughts, emotions, and individuality. It is the sense of being a unique person in the world, distinct from everyone else, while also being aware of your connections to others. At its core, selfhood involves understanding your personality, values, beliefs, strengths, weaknesses, and the experiences that have shaped you.

It also includes self-awareness, which is the ability to reflect on your own thoughts, feelings, and actions. For example, when you think about why you made a certain decision or how your emotions influence your behavior, you are exercising selfhood. This reflective ability allows individuals to grow, learn from experiences, and make conscious choices aligned with their true values.

            The story of Kashmir is a narrative of resilience, endurance, and unyielding hope, shaped by decades of political struggle, social upheaval, and the quest for identity. Since 1989, the region has experienced a profound transformation. Mass protests, political mobilizations, and the rise of liberation movements altered the social and political landscape, revealing both the courage and the challenges of the Kashmiri people. These years have not only tested the spirit of local communities but also exposed the complex dynamics between internal factions, state authorities, and broader international interests. The struggle of Kashmir is, therefore, not just a local issue; it resonates globally, symbolizing the challenges of balancing cultural identity, political autonomy, and peaceful coexistence in a region long marked by conflict.

Amid these challenges, Kashmiris have consistently asserted their commitment to preserving their unique cultural, linguistic, and social heritage. Declaring allegiance to their Kashmiri identity, even while participating in broader ideological or religious frameworks, is a powerful testament to the community’s determination to protect its traditions and values. This assertion of identity goes beyond symbolism; it represents a conscious effort to maintain continuity of culture, safeguard collective memory, and ensure that future generations inherit a strong, vibrant, and autonomous Kashmiri heritage. It demonstrates that local identity and global or religious solidarity can coexist without compromising the essence of either, creating a model for communities worldwide that face similar challenges.

Political developments have continued to intensify, with important meetings and strategic discussions reflecting the leadership’s focus on planning, coordination, and unity. These efforts are complemented by international attention, as diplomats, global organizations, and policymakers closely monitor the evolving situation in Kashmir. The participation of international actors underscores the significance of the region not only for its inhabitants but also for regional stability and global peace. By engaging in dialogue at both local and international levels, Kashmiris are shaping their political future thoughtfully, balancing immediate security concerns with long-term aspirations for autonomy and recognition.
